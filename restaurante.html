                We were especially inspired by the Spanish tapa.
                ‚Äç</h4>
            <p>
                You can come to us for a tapa with your wine or a refreshing cocktail, 
                but also for "La buena mesa" a richly filled table with good food.
                 We do this in one of Maastricht's most beautiful and historic streets. 
                 Together with our chef and our international team we are on a daily quest
                 for the right balance between Mediterranean cuisine and our burgundian Maastricht.

                    Best tapas in town At this moment by far the best tapas in town! I have ordered here 
                    before during the lockdown and now I eat here in the restaurant itself for the first time. 
                    It is just super tasty. Quality is excellent! Staff is friendly, some speak English, no problem for us,
                     but what is often the case in tapas restaurants that you have a well-filled wallet to take along.
                     That is not only here, but you do get value for money! Everything is equally delicious!

                    Tapas, every single one, delicious. Very friendly staff. First we sat outside, 
                    but it started to rain. In no time, the tables were inside, neatly spaced out, 
                    and everyone could continue eating there. 
                    When I went to report after the payment that they had counted only two wines instead of 4, 
                    it was so appreciated that we were offered those two wines from the company! Top!

                    <p>We have a selection of changing Mediterranean tapas on our menu that you can enjoy after work,
                         after shopping, or as dinner with friends, with family or as a couple. The casual atmosphere 
                         that comes with eating tapas and drinking good wine ensures a cozy 'Mediterranean' experience together.
                          Our approach is therefore, not everyone has his own plate with food (main course), but to order some 
                          different tapas and share so that everyone can taste as much as possible. We try to realize a full meal 
                          on the table with tapas (smaller dishes). Our tapas are sometimes larger than expected and are made for sharing.

                        It is a good idea that if you are 3, 4, 5 people or more, you consult with the service that you adjust the tapas 
                        to the number of people you are at the table with..</p>

                    <p>You are welcome to join us up to 7 people. Up to this number of pers. we can make one table for you. 
                        You can easily reserve a table online up to 5 people (from 6 pers. please call us). We recommend for
                         group reservations the La Barraca Men√∫ Sorpresa. This can be customized to your needs. You can also
                          change your reservation online and possibly cancel your table yourself. At La Barraca we work with 
                          shifts, you can choose these yourself and they will be clearly shown in our confirmation email. 
                          We ask for your cooperation. If you are with more than one person or if you want to stay longer at 
                          the table, we advise you to choose the last shift. Of course, we must adhere to the set closing time.</p>
